# Web Infrastructure Design

## Description
This project is a collection of web infrastructure designs that could be implemented in any web development project.

## Designs Presented

### Simple Web Stack
This design outlines a basic web infrastructure consisting of a web server, application server, and a database server. It is suitable for small to medium-sized web applications with moderate traffic and resource requirements.

### Distributed Web Infrastructure
This design presents a scalable, distributed web infrastructure that can handle high traffic and load. It includes load balancers, application servers, database servers, and caching mechanisms to distribute the workload across multiple nodes.

### Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
This design focuses on the security and monitoring aspects of a web infrastructure. It includes web application firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, centralized logging, and monitoring tools to ensure the overall health and security of the system.

### Scaled Up Web Infrastructure
This design demonstrates how to scale up a web infrastructure to handle large-scale web applications with high traffic and resource-intensive requirements. It incorporates techniques such as content delivery networks, auto-scaling, and advanced caching mechanisms.
